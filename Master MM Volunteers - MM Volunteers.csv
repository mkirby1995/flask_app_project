I was impressed and moved by your presentation at ADRx last Friday.

What resonated most with me was your narrative of the pain, emptiness, and abandonment one experiences with the loss of their social support system.

While your vivid stories were of those who are physically homeless, I couldn't help but feel that the same sense of isolation and marginalization can manifest for people who have lost their jobs, have had a love relationship disintegrate -- or who have been socially ostracized and outcast by communities they once belonged to.

Your presentation has given all of us something to reflect upon and to act on. Again, thank you for making ADRx a worthwhile experience!

I am not a wealthy man, but I am a hard-working one and volunteer here and there within local organizations with efforts to ease the pain of homelessness. In 2005, I founded a nonprofit organization to help the communities with problems of blight and slum lordism. After my father passed away in 2012, I went on hiatus, but now am ready to begin again with ""Project Homelessness"" as our new campaign within the city of Albuquerque.  I would appreciate any feedback or information on how to promote this project.

Thank you and may God greatly bless you!

I read about your project quite some time ago and was talking about it so many times already. Within the context of my masters program we have to do a volunteer project and I would love to know, whether there already is a bigger group in Berlin that is spreading the word about miracle messages  and taking some action to reunite homeless people with their relatives. There really is big need in Berlin as we have got many people living on the street here... Also, besides the toolkit do you have got any information on how to get started to build a bigger community here?

My name is Dylan Zhao and I am writing to apply for the virtual Program Internships FIND THEM and DIGITAL DETECTIVE. I am a freshman at UC Berkeley intending to major in Business or Economics, and I would love the privilege of a virtual internship at Miracle Messages this summer.

I learned about Miracle Messages when the founder and CEO Kevin Adler came to speak in my Political Science seminar. I was immediately struck by his statement that there has been a ""systemic loss of compassion"" within society, and I have since contemplated ways in which it can be brought back. This is what drove me to submit this application for an internship at Miracle Messages. I feel that if I can spend my summer helping people reconnect with their families, I will be doing my part to restore the compassion we have lost.

In terms of my credentials for the two positions, I offer:
- A background in both business and community service, as the past Vice President of Finance for a student-created non-profit retail company, and co-founder of the non-profit organization Objective Resolution Calgary (ORC), which introduced over 200 less-privileged youth to Model United Nations
- Outreach and marketing experience with the above two initiatives, in identifying customers, spreading social media and advertising campaigns, and, in the case of ORC, securing prolific guest speakers
- 6 years of experience in competitive debate and Model United Nations, developing my public speaking skills, communication, and ability to work in a team
- A solid educational and experiential foundation in accounting, finance, and business, as well as discussing such subjects on the national student publication, the “Intercollegiate Finance Journal”
- A history of excellent academic and workplace performance
- A genuine desire to help others and make my community (whether at school or home) a better place

I believe I have what it takes to consistently deliver on the responsibilities of a Program Intern (FIND THEM or DIGITAL DETECTIVE) at Miracle Messages. I can be reached at zhao.dylan@berkeley.edu, or by phone at 510-990-7878, and would be more than happy to submit a resume upon request. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dylan Zhao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My name is Jeremy Rosenberg and I am incredibly interested in interning with Miracle Messages this summer. I am a U.S. Army veteran and current Junior at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. A few weeks ago, Jess was a guest speaker for one of my classes (Professor Alan Ross). I was unaware of Miracle Messages at the time, but Jess's presentation was absolutely amazing and I knew immediately that I wanted to get involved with Miracle Messages.

If the opportunity is still available, I know this is where I want to be this summer. I'll be taking a few classes over the summer session, but I will have plenty of availability to commit to the 15-20+ hours per week.

I am interested in the following opportunities:
(1) General
(2) Digital Detective
(3) Find Them

I love the story of Miracle Messages. As someone who grew up in both San Francisco and Livermore, I have been accustomed to the normality that is homelessness. As a young kid, I was always told that people are homeless because they made bad decisions. That may be the case, it may not, but they are still human and I want to give my time to them and help them reconnect with their loved ones and hopefully get on back on track to living a healthy life, and one where they feel loved.

Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing back from you! Please feel free to contact me at any time!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am a veteran and have been looking for ways to help my fellow veterans and others who are down on their luck. It's not easy seeing such poverty on the streets and not knowing really what to do about it. It's one thing helping to feed the homeless in homeless shelters or on the street. It's another thing trying to help a person put their life back together again. As Kevin put it in his training message - it can be somewhat dangerous walking up to a stranger who has lived on the streets for a long period of time and try and pull information out of that individual, especially if they don't want to be found or are very private about their lives and what got them where they are today. Caution is paramount in todays society. I want to be apart of this organization, but only if I'm truly prepared to do the work needed to help those in need. Just going out and talking with people isn't as easy and/or safe anymore. I'm the kind of person that works better if I'm properly prepared to handle the situation than trying to fly off the cuff. That doesn't work well for me. Thanks for listening and God Bless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am the first embedded social worker in the Lansing Police Department. My first day was March 4th, so I am developing the program from the ground up. 

Your focus on the relational piece of homelessness is, in my mind, exactly what has been missing. Even if the family of a homeless citizen is not found, showing them someone understands, is trying, “gets it”, must be profoundly uplifting. They are not invisible to you, nor are their broken hearts. Revolutionary. 

As I begin here, one of my ideas it to connect with the chronically and persistently homeless one by one. We have a good housing network here, but too often the homeless end up in jail. I’m not sure exactly how yet, but I’d like to change that outcome. The only place to start is meeting them, one by one.  I intend to walk with them from time to time, maybe once a week or so. I intend to develop relationships with them. Your piece would add “teeth”, if you will. 

I’m hoping we can have a conversation. (517)-898-6344

I’ve been involved in a few projects through ProgCode (Represent, Who Targets Me) and am looking for some new problems to help solve. Homelessness is very prominant in London, especially Victoria where the office is located. After watching someone OD against the glass windows of the office last weekend, my frustration reached a peak and I decided to see what organisations were working in this field. Turns out not that many, at least that are easy for developers to engage with and donate some hours to. I’d be keen to hear if there’s a London group for Miracle Messages as it seems like a very reasonable approach to this issue. In terms of time, I have the whole of Tuesday to try something out - and if it goes well I would look at donating time more regularly and perhaps encouraging some of my coworkers to get involved.

My names Michaela Lumia and I'm a sophomore at Loyola Marymount University. I am a marketing major with a studio arts minor. I would love to work with Miracle Messages as a Story Telling Intern. I have always wanted to work for a non-profit, especially one related to homelessness. I'm from the east coast and I would visit New York City many times every year to see my Grandfather in Manhattan. I have a distinct memory from when I was probably 7 years old of a homeless man standing at the top of the subway stairs. I didn't really understand what homelessness was at the time. It was the middle of winter and he had no shoes. He was only wearing battered and torn white wool socks- the same type the my dad wears. Seeing him standing in the same socks as my dad stuck my heart. It made me realize that these homeless people are actual people with families and stories. What if that man had a daughter too? What if one day that was my dad standing there instead? At the time, that realization shocked me and filled me with sadness. Ever since then, I knew I wanted to do something to help people experiencing homelessness. I would love to be able to help in the best way I know how. Being a studio arts minor, I have a lot of experience in Adobe Suite and other video platforms. I have also worked since I've been 15 years old so I know the importance of being accountable, responsible, and timely. I would be happy to send you my resume or chat more about the internship and my interest! Thank you for your time and consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She became legally dead while alive, in 2012, and we have been on the phone since, very briefly, where she was cut off, as she explained where she is. I have no phone number for her, as that number was set up to not show on my phone. I am her biological daughter Kim Elizabeth Weir aka Hari Simran Kaur Khalsa DOB: May 2, 1953. My name is now legally BOTH names, but my Driver's License is in: Hari Simran Kaur Khalsa. I am 64 years old, and temporarily homeless in my car, in the Los Angeles area, since September 29, 2016. I am doing fine, and my car is excellent, and it has full registration with the CA DMV, and tags, and my Driver's License is up to date. I carry full auto insurance, and I could come pick up my mother, if I have the gas money to do so, and if she is free. She may be in the Sacramento area, near the Carlton Senior Assisted Living, in an unknown and unmarked home, but I am not sure of this. My funds are limited, and driving North would cost in gas and food and so forth, some several hundreds of dollars realistically. Please advise, if you have any ideas as to how to proceed. She may have a twin or a friend named Mary Kay Weir, who is mistaken for her, but I am not sure of this. My biological sister Laurie Hope Weir DOB: April 19, 1955, in Carmichael, CA does not communicate in response to voice mails or emails, and is not in town, if I come to her town, in the past. Thus, I know my mother is looking for me, as my sister will not connect us, and might seek to stop our connection. She has an unknown twin or look alike cousin, who is mistaken for her, as well. If I could make touch with my mother, and come to her, we could make plans to live together, or at least visit and be on the phone together. I could work to support the two of us, but only from an apartment, as living in the car does not work for this, as so many know.  Thanks for all that you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to SF, NYC has a modest number of homeless people, albeit slighty less in absolute terms. I see at least two people on the streets everyday during my commute to work and have always thought about ways to help them and find a longer-term solution to get them off the streets. Given that I work in finance, I have thought about ways to pool donations to maximize their benefits or to teach them the basic skills of saving to provide a long term solution to their problems. However, I haven’t been able to create a good solution yet. I think your solution tackles the problem in a different way and I would love to help in any way I can.

2019-04-16 3:19:06,christopheperie@gmail.com,Christophe,Perie, (064) 757-1511,Paris,,France,Partnering,"Hi Kevin

As I told you on our FB Messenger quick talk I am very interested to develop the idea of ​​Miracle Messages (which is wonderful and very powerful) in France.

The rate of French homeless is estimated at about 150,000, although no serious investigation has been conducted since 2012 on this subject. However, we know that this rate has increased by 50% in ten years in our country. I have also a personal story with this as I told you.

Also I'm working at developing and producing some social documentaries for TV and theater since one year with great and famous directors in France with my partner Julien Hossein. We think, with Julien, we can involve some celebrities from film, television, and the industrial world in France to this cause. For example, perhaps creating a homeless caring system by some of these personalities to attract even more the medias on Miracle Messages and then attract funding to help more and more homeless people reconnect with their families and loved ones.

We are also wondering whether it would not be interesting to extend this idea to the issue of migrants. In France and Europe, more and more people are now migrating from their home countries to our countries in order to flee tyrannical political regimes, climatic conditions of life that have become impossible, or extreme poverty.  Those people quickly lose sight of their families and loved ones and finally lives as homeless in our country. They might need to send Miracle Messages with our help too.

In order to create a Miracle Messages home in Paris/France, what do we need ? We need to know how you want to deal with that. Is there a ‘franchise’ to pay? Do we have the opportunity to create our own ideas to develop Miracle Messages in our country? What ‘business model’ do you operate on? And finally, we will need to know how surveys work to find homeless families and loved ones.

Looking foward to your reply.

Best regards,

Christophe Perie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I discovered your association on Linkedin, through a video posted by a media called BRUT.
Congatulations for your job and all your achievements.

Since i am a child, i see my god father alternating good and bad periods. He is one of the best friend of my dad, and suddently miss everything following alcohol troubles. 
During many years he lived in the street or in precarious housing, with no contacts with anybody.
My father searched him many times and sometimes found him for a couple of days, before he disappeared again....
He broke links with all his friends and all his family, including his only child, who is the same age than me (35yo now) and stayed closed to my parents during all those years.

Last week, reading a local newpaper we have been informed that my godfather passed over. Alone. Without his family. Without his friends.
Whereas i am sure all of us could have offer a better life, or at least a better end of life to him....

As i am sensitive to the cause of the homeless, and now live in Pairs where we see all days new people living in the streets, i would like to know if your great initiative could be duplicated in France.

Looking forward to hearng about you.

Brice, 28 living in Paris, France.

I just found out about your amazing project. Congratulations, you’re the type of person who definitely improve our broken society.
I am wondering if you have opened an office in France already.
As a lot of homeless people sleep in our streets too, and are sadly disconnected from the others, I felt many times that the first step for them to come back from this was through their closest relatives. 
I used to work with emergency shelters for homeless people but quickly got to realize this wasn’t a sustainable situation.

Therefore, I would gladly discuss with you about the eventuality of growing MM in France.

Feel free to come back to me answering to this email, it will be a pleasure to learn more about you, and hopefully getting to add my stone to your monument.

Congratulations again, I’m really amazed by people like you.

My name is Erica Schwartzmann, and I am the Arizona State University & St. Vincent de Paul Program Manager.  Arizona State University (ASU) and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul (SVdP) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding during Fall 2017 in response to a determined need to strengthen the on-going and innovative collaborative relationship between the two partners.  My jointly funded position was created to support the development of mutually beneficial outcomes.  

As you may know, St. Vincent de Paul’s mission is to Feed, Clothe, House, and Heal individuals in need and to provide opportunities for the community to positively impact those in need through service.  The organization serves individuals on the poverty line but also those who experience chronic homelessness.  The no barrier overflow shelter in Maricopa County that is housed within the St. Vincent de Paul Downtown Phoenix Dining Room is set to close in September, as a result of funders reallocating funding to more permanent housing solutions.  Closing of the shelter has placed even more urgency around finding successful ways to divert or reunify individuals experiencing homelessness.  

We know that Miracle Messages presents an amazing opportunity to help reconnect those individuals experiencing homelessness with their families thereby ending their homelessness.  The SVdP & ASU Partnership has a unique opportunity to partner with an ASU Faculty, Professor Sandy Price, in the ASU College of Public Service & Community Solutions to pilot a program similar to Miracle Messages in her Nonprofit Leadership & Management (NLM) 160 – Voluntary Action & Community Leadership Course.  

We are would appreciate an opportunity to talk with the Kevin Adler, Jess Donig, and the rest of the Miracle Messages team to learn more about the operations of Miracle Messages and see how we may partner to support a similar effort in Phoenix, Arizona.  

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you, 

Erica Schwartzmann",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She has no biological family at all, that she knows of, and she is really lonely and longs to find some type of biological relative. She found herself growing up in a foster family who were cruel to her, abusive, and they even had their names replaced on her birth certificate, instead of her biological parents (through one of their relatives who worked in that department in Dallas.)  Demetrice is really sweet and in her twenties. But she is utterly alone, lonely, and deathly afraid of any contact with her foster family who also named her. They have been estranged for years too. I was excited to find this organization and hope we can help her find her real birth name and her real family. She thinks she may have been part of a set of quintuplets that got separated. Hope to hear how we can move forward on this and excited to know this miracle organization exists!  Thank you, --Anna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am particularly interested in seeing what's it would would take to get Miracle Messages started in Salt Lake City. A little background on me, I am a pre-med student and need to have leadership and volunteering experience for my application in a few years. Helping the homeless population here is something I feel very strongly about. 

A little background on me, I am a little bit older than a traditional college student (over 30). I am an army veteran, and I have a masters degree, so I am a bit more ""seasoned"" than a typical college student. I currently volunteer with a community health clinic that serves a lot of homeless patients. 

I am just doing some initial research into what my options are, so I can't commit to anything but I would love to talk to somebody about volunteering with your organization. 

Email is the best method to contact me.

Thank you,

I'm currently a junior at Stanford University studying Political Science and with a passionate interest in public policy and social entrepreneurship. I learned about Miracle Message from Courtney Cooperman, a fellow junior and one of my freshman dorm mates. Miracle Message seems to be an unwavering force for good in the community and I would be excited to join the team and help pursue the company's mission in any way I can. I am particularly interested in interning with Miracle Messages this summer, but would also be interested in assisting remotely by helping to reconnect loved ones.

I've reunited over 200 families in 20 years.  I look out for the homeless guys that sleep on the church steps.  One has a bad back injury from the Viet Nam war and went into the VA hospital.  His buddy saw me on the street and said he'd like to find his friend's brother who lives in Marin he gave me his name and by chance his 97 year old mom was visiting from Florida.  The brother had not seen him in 10 years and the mom had not seen him in 30 years.  They went to the hospital to see him on his birthday and my daughter and I did too.  Now he has housing but sometimes I still see him on the street.  I love helping and your organization sounds wonderful.I have a real job but is there anything I can do to help your organization?  I'm not afraid to go into homeless camps.  I give out wrapped gifts every cristmas eve in homeless camps of new socks i collect them all year and wrap them in paper with bows so that they have a wrapped gift to open on Christmas propper.  I get called Christmas sock lady I've been handing them out with my kid since she was a baby. And thank you for what you are doing I'm sure it makes a big difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I read about your organization in the Chronicle today and was inspired by your mission.

Also, I recently started working at Apple and they donate $25 for each hour that I volunteer which could help raise funds for your organization. 

Unfortunately, given my work schedule, it's hard for me to commit to doing field work, but if there's anyway to help contact these peoples' relatives remotely, I'd love to get involved.

If there are any upcoming trainings or events, please let me know!

I came to your site and immediately checked your board -- the measure of an organization's true priorities. I wonder if you've ever realized how white your board is, and how out of touch with street-level issue they seem. I'm not filling this form out to volunteer, but to volunteer a suggestion -- that you engage with some people of color and ensure that your board reflects the population you serve. Otherwise, you really won't be able to do good work.

It made me wonder if his daughters know that their dad is living on the streets. He seems like a nice man, but may have some mental health issues. I was hoping we could find a way to reach out to his family if they are around. I just don’t know how to go about it and how to ask him if he knows where his daughters are and how to reach them. Can you help?

Thanks so much to you all for the presence of MM in our world!

On 12.06.2018 I heard Kevin share with Steve on the Humanity's Team call - thank you! I really felt my heart joining with MM's essence and purpose. I had heard of MM and today's call confirmed making the connection.

Please let me know who to contact about connecting with an existing MM presence in San Jose. I see DTST is listed. Also, there may be other opportunities for me to serve, based on my ministry and corporate skills (I've done fundraising ;) )

I'm a grateful community servant, here to share and support welcoming and loving all of our neighbors!

Peace and blessings,
Cecely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This way, they can get a small boost to get themselves back on their feet. As you said on your website, it is more expensive to keep the homeless on the streets. The money saved can be used towards this.

My name is Uma Mahto and I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego. I majored in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics and minored in Design and Entrepreneurship & Innovation. This past quarter for my Design class I worked on a final project trying to help tackle basic needs insecurity and the needs of the homeless population. In fact, we even sent an email earlier in April/May about collecting some primary research and data for the project. That was when I came across your internship postings. Now that I'm home in the Bay, I want to continue working on problems that really matter and make a big impact.

Out of the 8 opportunities listed, 6 really speak to me as being a potential good fit. Given my background in computer science  and data analysis through bioinformatics, both the technical intern and data program intern role are ones I could see myself taking on. This technical background with my interests in design also make the design intern role one I could see myself in. However the roles that interest me the most are the general program intern, digital detective, and find them program intern. I think this is because of my desire to be more involved with the organization and people. I think I would be a really good fit for the general program intern role and would be able to learn a lot while maximizing my contribution to the organization. 

I look forward to hearing from you and about other ways to get involved! Also if you're interested, here's the link to my final presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CDZ9y8Jd1rr38fadbV4RpqqkQjexpdbo_U6GnP3oqSY/edit?usp=sharing

I've worked as a volunteer for three years at the Downtown Women's Center on Skid Row, where the motto is ""Every Woman Housed."".  My sense is that re-housing our homeless population is the first and foremost best way to address this condition.My life long town, Santa Monica, has for many decades been referred to as ""The Home of the Homeless"" and our residents are reaching now critical mass in protest as homelessness keeps increasing here as everywhere else. Many of our current residents are fairly new to homelessness and at wits end not knowing how to proceed. I'm interested in bringing your organization and approach to the attention of our city leaders as they are putting forth attempts yet falling short in many ways in addressing the situation. Your approach is the most logical and practical in my estimation and I think if instituted here (we have lots of money!) it could very well be a shining beacon for expansion of Miracle Messages throughout the USA and beyond. I'm going to attend a community forum tomorrow. I'm not impressed that the instruction to business owners and residents is to ""show up and be ready to listen and ask questions"" as there is no room indicated for a well-rounded discussion that includes suggestions from residents. Please let me know your thoughts on this and I'm happy to be involved in bridging Miracle Messages to the City. My sense is it could be very successful! Thank you,Melissa Ward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this school year at Stanford I have become jaded with academia and felt the urge to be doing hands-on service.  During high school I had the chance to work with Regina Evans working to combat the human trafficking issue rampant in Oakland.  That summer I noticed that a root cause of women forced into the sex trafficking business, is poverty and homelessness.  Our approach then was to hire victims of trafficking and offer them employment as well as a creative means (in forms of live performances) to express and heal from their suffering.  
Recently I took a course on human trafficking and felt rather frustrated at the theoretical discussions with no real applications to help mitigate the issue.  I imagine this internship would be a great way to start on a grassroots and community level.  I want to make change and feel like the work I'm doing amounts to impactful differences for other people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am extremely interested in the program internship with Miracle Messages. For the past two summers, I've been lucky enough to work for start-ups that had incredible impacts (one that worked on remedying food insecurity and the other that was dedicated to getting women back into the workforce after career breaks) and I hope to continue the trend. I believe that the work that Miracle Messages does is very necessary and inspiring. My own family are all Khmer Rouge genocide survivors. On their way to America, most of them lost connections to their family and had absolutely no way of reconnecting. I witnessed first hand what the loss of community can do to humans and I want to be part of a team that helps create networks of support. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'd love to talk more to the team and would be happy to send along a resume that highlights my qualifications. You can reach me at jbseng@stanford.edu or 520-235-1594.

Working as a lawyer for 3 years, I have been trying to give a new meaning to my life and my impact on this land. I would be happy to help you set up such an association in France.
Feel free to contact me.
Best regards,

My name is Ashlee - I'm a graphic designer and marketer currently based in Vancouver, BC, Canada. As Vancouver has one of the largest homeless populations in Canada, I have see people nearly every day who could very easily use a helping hand. That said, I absolutely love what you guys are doing and believe that reuniting individuals with their family is one area in which I would love to do my part.

I am keen to use my skills, experience, and knowledge to help further the MM movement - I'm just curious as to where/in what format a design/marketing role could fit. I see you have a Design Internship currently open but am wondering if there is more of a full-on position available on the MM team? If not, no worries though!

Thank you in advance and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you

I have walked the streets of san francisco many times and i am well aware of how bad the homeless population has gotten over the past couple of years in our city. Its easy to overlook the homeless population as lazy and ignorant, thinking that they did this to themeselves. But the truth is everyone has there own story and deserves a chance at redemption to get their life back. 
Anyways at the end of your speech you said to contact you if you wanted to get involved, so here I am.
